# Compiler Design Project
Welcome to the Compiler Design Project! This project focuses on implementing a basic compiler that processes a simple programming language. The compiler performs lexical analysis and parsing to recognize and validate the syntax of the input code.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a compiler for a simple programming language with a straightforward syntax. The compiler consists of a lexer and a parser, which together analyze and validate the code. The lexer breaks down the code into tokens, while the parser checks the syntax against predefined grammar rules.

**The project consists of three main components:**
* Lexer: Tokenizes the input code and identifies constants, operators, keywords, identifiers, and special characters.
* Parser: Implements LL(1) parsing to compute first and follow sets and generate a parse table.
* Validation: Validates input strings against the generated parse table to check for syntactic correctness.

## Input Program
The input to the compiler is a simple C-like program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using a `for` loop and an `if` statement. Here's an example of the input program:

### The following is the sample input for the project:
      int main()
      begin
        int m, n, i, gcd;
        if(expr <= expr)
          gcd = i;
        for(i=1; expr <= expr; ++i)
        begin
          gcd=1;
        end
      end

## Lexer
The lexer is responsible for reading the input program and generating a sequence of tokens. It recognizes keywords, identifiers, operators, and other symbols.

### Lexer Features:
* **Digit Recognition:** Identifies numeric constants.
* **Operator Detection:** Differentiates between arithmetic and relational operators.
* **Keyword Identification:** Detects keywords such as int, if, for, begin, and end.
* **Error Handling:** Flags illegal characters in the input.

## Parser
The parser uses the tokens generated by the lexer to construct a parse tree and validate the syntax according to grammar rules. It calculates the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for non-terminals and builds a parsing table to guide syntax analysis.

### Parser Features:
* **FIRST and FOLLOW Sets:** Computes these sets for grammar analysis.
* **Parse Table Generation:** Constructs a table to assist with syntax validation.
* **Stack Buffer Parsing:** Validates the input string using a stack-based approach.
* **Grammar Classification:** Determines if the grammar is LL(1) or not.

## Running the Project
### To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
. Place the input code in a file named input.txt.
3. Execute the main script to analyze the input program:

       python main.py
   
4. Review the output to see the tokens, FIRST and FOLLOW sets, parsing table, and the validation result of the input program.
